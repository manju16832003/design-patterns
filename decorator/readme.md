# Decorator Pattern

The decorator pattern (Wrapper) is a design pattern that allows behaviour to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behaviour of the other objects from the same class.

Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

- No Inheritance
- SOLID Principles (OCP - Open for extension and closed for modifications)
- Change and Adjust behaviour in some way, decorator is the pattern might be helpful.
